# opencode-gitbutler

[![npm version](https://img.shields.io/npm/v/opencode-gitbutler)](https://www.npmjs.com/package/opencode-gitbutler)

Stop managing git branches manually and let your AI agents do the heavy lifting with GitButler.

## Why This Plugin?

AI agents generate code at a pace that manual version control can't match. Without automation, you end up with massive commits, messy branch organization, and generic messages that make code review a nightmare.

This plugin bridges the gap by bringing GitButler's virtual branch power directly into your OpenCode agent sessions.

### What This Plugin Does Differently

- Only tool that combines automatic branch creation, LLM commits, file assignment, and context injection.
- Zero-config setup. Just add it to your plugins and go.
- Works with GitButler virtual branches to avoid worktree overhead.
- Impersonates Cursor for full GitButler CLI compatibility.
- Session-first routing: every edit/write is assigned via `but cursor after-edit`.
- Unique multi-agent session mapping so subagents stay on the parent branch.
- Hunk-level rub guard in post-stop recovery to avoid unsafe auto-moves.

## Installation

### 1. Add plugin to OpenCode config

Add to your `opencode.json` (global or project-level):

```json
{
  "plugin": [
    "opencode-gitbutler@latest"
  ]
}
```

OpenCode will install the plugin automatically on next launch.

### 2. Install GitButler CLI

```bash
brew install gitbutler
```

See [GitButler installation docs](https://docs.gitbutler.com/installation) for other methods.

### 3. Install the GitButler skill (recommended)

The plugin includes a skill that teaches your agent GitButler commands, safety rules, and workflows. Install it as a project-level skill so the agent can load it on demand:

```bash
npx skills add https://github.com/gaboe/opencode-gitbutler --skill but --agent opencode --yes
```

> **Why?** The plugin handles automation (auto-branch, auto-commit), but the agent also needs to know how to use `but` commands directly. Without the skill, the agent falls back to raw `git` commands which break the GitButler workspace.

### 4. Restart OpenCode

The plugin automatically:
- Routes every `edit`/`write` through GitButler's `after-edit`
- Creates and renames branches based on your prompts
- Rewords commit messages using Claude Haiku (with deterministic fallback)
- Injects workspace state notifications into agent context
- Checks for updates on session creation

## How Branch Assignment Works

This plugin uses a session-first flow. In practice:

1. On every `edit`/`write`, the plugin resolves your **root session** (parent session for subagents).
2. It derives a deterministic `conversation_id` from that root session (or from `branch_target`, when configured).
3. It always calls `but cursor after-edit` with that `conversation_id` and file path.
4. On idle/stop, it calls `but cursor stop` for that same `conversation_id`.
5. In post-stop processing, it may:
   - sweep edited files and `but rub` unassigned changes when attribution is safe,
   - reword commit message,
   - rename default `ge-branch-*` names,
   - sync OpenCode session title,
   - clean empty default branches.

This avoids cross-session branch pollution and keeps subagent edits attached to the parent session branch.

## Configuration

Create `.opencode/gitbutler.json` in your workspace root to override defaults:

```json
{
  // Enable debug logging to .opencode/plugin/debug.log
  "log_enabled": true,

  // LLM provider and model for commit message generation
  "commit_message_provider": "anthropic",
  "commit_message_model": "claude-haiku-4-5",

  // Timeout for LLM requests (milliseconds)
  "llm_timeout_ms": 15000,

  // Maximum diff size to send to LLM (characters)
  "max_diff_chars": 4000,

  // Maximum length of auto-generated branch slugs
  "branch_slug_max_length": 50,

  // Enable automatic version update checks
  "auto_update": true,

  // Regex pattern for default branch detection
  "default_branch_pattern": "^ge-branch-\\d+$",

  // Milliseconds before file lock is considered stale
  "stale_lock_ms": 300000,

  // Max age of pending notifications before expiry
  "notification_max_age_ms": 300000,

  // Enable branch inference heuristics in post-stop sweep
  "inference_enabled": true,

  // Optional: force all sessions onto one branch seed
  "branch_target": "",

  // Reserved (currently no-op)
  "edit_debounce_ms": 200,
  "gc_on_session_start": false
}
```

## Feature Parity vs Native Integrations

## Known Operational Limits

- The plugin only performs GitButler actions in workspace mode (`gitbutler/workspace` branch).
- If `branch_target` is set, all sessions intentionally share one branch seed.
- `edit_debounce_ms` and `gc_on_session_start` are reserved config fields and are currently no-op.
- GitButler CLI still has upstream edge cases around unapply/pull after squash-merge with deleted remote branches (see linked issues in `docs/gitbutler-integration.md`).

## Troubleshooting

### GitButler CLI not found

**Error:** `⚠ GitButler CLI not found. Install with: brew install gitbutler`

**Solution:** Install GitButler via Homebrew:
```bash
brew install gitbutler
```

The plugin will work without it, but workspace commands will fail at runtime.

### Config file not found

If `.opencode/gitbutler.json` is missing, the plugin uses all defaults. No error is raised.

### Debug logging

Enable `log_enabled: true` in config to write detailed logs to `.opencode/plugin/debug.log`. Useful for diagnosing branch creation, commit message generation, and state injection issues.

### Wrong branch assignment

If changes still appear on an unexpected branch:

1. Ensure `branch_target` is not set in `.opencode/gitbutler.json`.
2. Check `.opencode/plugin/session-map.json` and confirm subagent sessions resolve to the expected parent.
3. Inspect `.opencode/plugin/debug.log` for `after-edit`, `session-stop`, and `branch-collision` events.
4. Run `but status --json -f` and verify where the file is currently assigned.

### LLM timeout

If commit message generation times out, increase `llm_timeout_ms` in config:
```json
{
  "llm_timeout_ms": 30000
}
```

### Large diffs

If diffs are truncated, increase `max_diff_chars`:
```json
{
  "max_diff_chars": 8000
}
```
